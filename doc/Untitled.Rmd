```
The top frequent words are relating to "friend", "family", "birthday", "job", "dinner", "husband", "daughter",etc. These words showed the core source of happiniess for these people and it reflects what they value the most in their lives. Most of their happiness are relating to friends, Thus, friends play an indispensible role throughout people's lives no matther what ages they are in, no matter what gender they are, and no matter if they are single or married. \newline
Then, I want know as people are getting old, how will their source of happiness change. I will look at top frequent words for people in different ages.

\newline
Other than the top frequent words all people are talking about, teenagers also talk about "game","event", "girlfriend", "finished", "college", "exam" frenquently. \newline
As for people in 20s, they talk more about "family", "home", "job", "night". \newline
For people in 30s, "friend", "family" are still top frequent words. Other than that, "son", "daughter", "wife", "husband" become top frequent words. \newline
For people in 40s, their top frequent words are similar to those of people in 30s. \newline
For people who are older than 50, their top frequent words are still relating to family and friends, which are "friend", "daughter", "husband", "son", "home", "wife".And there are some new words appeared in the list, which are "visit", "dog", "love". \newline
As we can see from these top frequent words list, some words are relating to each other. For example, "exam" will be associated with "school" in our common sense. Next, I want to know which words are correlated. 



```{r}
hm_data$sentence_length <- sapply(strsplit(hm_data$original_hm, " "), length)
```


```{r}
ggplot(hm_data, aes(x=age,color=gender, y=sentence_length)) +
  geom_point(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",size=.15) 
```


```{r}
# a <- hm_bigrams
# a<- a$bigram
# a <- unlist(strsplit(a," "))
# #dat <- data_frame(group = rep(1:37829), factor = hm_data$count,
# dat <- data_frame(group = rep(1:(979612/2), each = 2),
#                   letter = a)
# title_word_pairs<-pairwise_count(dat, letter, group)
# 
# desc_word_pairs <-pairwise_count(dat, letter,group, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE)
# 
```


```{r}
set.seed(1234)
# title_word_pairs %>%
#   filter(n >= 250) %>%
#   graph_from_data_frame() %>%
#   ggraph(layout = "fr") +
#   geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = "cyan4") +
#   geom_node_point(size = 5) +
#   geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, 
#                  point.padding = unit(0.2, "lines")) +
#   theme_void()
```

```{r}
# set.seed(1234)
# desc_word_pairs %>%
#   filter(n >= 150) %>%
#   graph_from_data_frame() %>%
#   ggraph(layout = "fr") +
#   geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = "darkred") +
#   geom_node_point(size = 5) +
#   geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE,
#                  point.padding = unit(0.2, "lines")) +
#   theme_void()
```

As we can see from this correlation map, "friend" is correlated with many words. That means people did many things with their friends. Also, "video"" is correlated with "game" and "played", they means people always use these three words together. And "offer", "job", "interview" are correlated with each other. 

```{r}
# keyword_cors <- nasa_keyword %>% 
#   group_by(keyword) %>%
#   filter(n() >= 50) %>%
#   pairwise_cor(keyword, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE)
# 
# keyword_cors
```

### Create bigrams using the text data

```{r,echo = FALSE}
hm_bigrams <- hm_data %>%
  filter(count != 1) %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

bigram_counts <- hm_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
```





```{r}
ggplot(hm_bigrams, aes(x=ground_truth_category)) +
  geom_density() 
```


```{r}
#  temp <- bag_of_words  %>%
 #    count(!!as.name(bag_of_words$gender), word) %>%
  #    group_by(!!as.name(bag_of_words$gender)) %>%
  #   mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  #    select(-n) %>% 
  #    spread(!!as.name(bag_of_words$gender), proportion)
    
  #    ggplot(temp, 
  #           aes_string(x = colnames(temp)[2], y = colnames(temp)[3]),
  #           color = abs(colnames(temp)[3] - colnames(temp)[2])) +
  #    geom_abline(color = "gray40", lty = 2) +
  #    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 1, width = 0.3, height = 0.3) +
  #   geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5) 
  #   scale_x_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  #   scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  #  scale_color_gradient(limits = c(0, 0.001), low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75") +
  #  theme(legend.position="none")
```


```{r}
# 
# hm_bigrams %>%
#       count(!!as.name(gender), bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
#       group_by(!!as.name(gender)) %>%
#       top_n(10) %>%
#       ungroup() %>%
#       mutate(bigram = reorder(bigram, n)) %>% 
#       ggplot(aes(bigram, n, fill = !!as.name(gender))) +
#       geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
#       facet_wrap(as.formula(paste("~", gender)), ncol = 2, scales = "free") +

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
